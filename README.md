MegaMocapVR is a project for Unreal Engine used to drive humanoid character animation live in editor using SteamVR hardware.  This motion can be used in take recorder for the creation of cinematics/animations or be used in streaming for VTuber applications.

Complete set-up guide using Unreal Engine 5 done using early access: the process still applies to UE 5.0.  Just replace the words 'VRMocap' with 'MMVR' and you should be good to go!

Thanks so much, and I hope this project helps you create awesome streams and animations.  I want this tool to be free for everyone to use, so if you add any features that might benefit others or fix any workflow painpoints I would love to incorporate those changes into the core of VRMocap!
